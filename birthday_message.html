        <p>Hello Cici,</p>
        <p>Happy birthday.</p>
        <p>May you live long, stay mentally well, and remain emotionally stable.</p>
        <p>I just want to say</p>
        <p>That I'm sorry for all the mistakes I've made towards you such as lying, making you overthink, and more, maybe even more than I realize.</p>
        <p>And I really like you, to me, you are the light in my life, you are the sunflower in the midst of many roses, you are the moon among the stars.</p>
        <p>Honestly, I've liked many women before you, but they all hurt me and at that moment I realized that all women are the same, then I chose not to like women anymore, not to get married for life. But all that changed when I met you again, I realized that you were the one I've been looking for all along. At that moment, I vowed that if it wasn't for you, then it wouldn't be for anyone else, and made you the last. I don’t think I’ll ever know how to love someone else, the way I love you, you are the last person I ever want to love like this and I promise you that I will hold on to us until my hands are buried by the earth.</p>
        <p>I don't mind if you choose someone else over me, if so, whoever that person is, they are the luckiest among the lucky ones. But I will still continue to hope that I am the lucky one.</p>
        <p>As you know, I used to get jealous when I saw you getting closer to other men besides me. But over time I realized that it's not my nature to be jealous like that especially since we are now just friends (I hope it can be more than that)</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, on March 8th, I said to you "keep getting angry" (forgive me), believe me, I didn't mean that you're easily angry, but it's from myself, it's my inner child, since I was a child I was more often scolded than loved, that's what makes me think others are angry even if they just raise their voice a little.</p>
        <p>I just want to convey this, I just hope you understand how I feel, even if not, it's okay.</p>
        <p>That's all, once again happy birthday Cici.</p>
